\page opengeode_how_to_compile_module How to configure and compile an OpenGeode module

This page explains how to configure and compile a module that depends on OpenGeode, 
either is it an existing module (for instance OpenGeode-Geosciences) or \link opengeode_how_to_create_module your own module\endlink.
As for \link opengeode_how_to_compile OpenGeode configuration and compilation\endlink, the procedure is very simple.


# What do you need

You need exactly the same tools than for compiling OpenGeode (given \link opengeode_how_to_compile here\endlink).
You also need to have installed OpenGeode


As for OpenGeode configuration and compilation, this step depends on your platform.
Follow the same \link opengeode_how_to_compile procedure\endlink than for OpenGeode but by specifying the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to OpenGeode install path. 

For example:

\code
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/OpenGeode/build/opengeode/install ..
\endcode
