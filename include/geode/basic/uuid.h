/*
 * Modified and simplified version of https://github.com/r-lyeh-archived/sole
 * Only UUID version 4 is kept.
 */

/* Sole is a lightweight C++11 library to generate universally unique
 identificators.
 * Sole provides interface for UUID versions 0, 1 and 4.

 * https://github.com/r-lyeh/sole
 * Copyright (c) 2013,2014,2015 r-lyeh. zlib/libpng licensed.

 * Based on code by Dmitri Bouianov, Philip O'Toole, Poco C++ libraries and
 anonymous
 * code found on the net. Thanks guys!

 * Theory: (see Hoylen's answer at [1])
 * - UUID version 1 (48-bit MAC address + 60-bit clock with a resolution of
 100ns)
 *   Clock wraps in 3603 A.D.
 *   Up to 10000000 UUIDs per second.
 *   MAC address revealed.
 *
 * - UUID Version 4 (122-bits of randomness)
 *   See [2] or other analysis that describe how very unlikely a duplicate is.
 *
 * - Use v1 if you need to sort or classify UUIDs per machine.
 *   Use v1 if you are worried about leaving it up to probabilities (e.g. your
 are the
 *   type of person worried about the earth getting destroyed by a large
 asteroid in your
 *   lifetime). Just use a v1 and it is guaranteed to be unique till 3603 AD.
 *
 * - Use v4 if you are worried about security issues and determinism. That is
 because
 *   v1 UUIDs reveal the MAC address of the machine it was generated on and they
 can be
 *   predictable. Use v4 if you need more than 10 million uuids per second, or
 if your
 *   application wants to live past 3603 A.D.

 * Additionally a custom UUID v0 is provided:
 * - 16-bit PID + 48-bit MAC address + 60-bit clock with a resolution of 100ns
 since Unix epoch
 * - Format is EPOCH_LOW-EPOCH_MID-VERSION(0)|EPOCH_HI-PID-MAC
 * - Clock wraps in 3991 A.D.
 * - Up to 10000000 UUIDs per second.
 * - MAC address and PID revealed.
